                        Phoebe Lucille Bridgers was born in Pasadena, California, on August 17, 1994.[1][2] Her mother, Jamie, works in real estate and stand up comedy, while her father was a film and television set builder. She has a younger brother named Jackson.[1] Her parents divorced when she was 19 years old.[3] She was raised in Pasadena, but also spent some of her childhood in Ukiah, California.[1][4] As a child, she made extra money by busking at the Pasadena Farmers Market,[3] and started playing guitar around the age of 13.[1] After graduating from the Sequoyah School, she began studying vocal jazz at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts in 2009.[5][6] She was later accepted into the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out after orientation.[7]

                    <h4>Early beginnings and  <a href="#">Stranger in the Alps</a> (2014–2018)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Bridgers was a member of various groups while still in high school, including Einstein's Dirty Secret and Sloppy Jane, and frequently played shows around Los Angeles as a solo act.[8][9] After deciding not to attend college to focus on her career, her growing presence in the L.A. music scene led to her befriending producer Tony Berg, who began working with her on her first album for free.[10] Playing in an Apple commercial with Sloppy Jane had given her some financial security, so she planned to complete her record and then sell it to a label, rather than attempting to get signed first. This allowed her much more time and creative freedom to create what would become Stranger in the Alps.[11] Around this time, Bridgers met American singer-songwriter Ryan Adams through mutual collaborators, and he put out her EP Killer on his label PAX AM.[12][13][14][15][16] Bridgers also supported Julien Baker on her 2016 tour of the East Coast.[17][18]

                        In January 2017, Bridgers released the single "Smoke Signals" and opened for Conor Oberst on his European tour.[19] The two had met the previous summer at a secret showcase, organized by Oberst at the Bootleg Theater in Los Angeles. He and his Bright Eyes bandmate, Mike Mogis, contributed vocals and production to Stranger in the Alps.[20] Bridgers joined The Joy Formidable and Ryan Adams for select dates on their respective U.S. tours before playing at South by Southwest in March 2017.[19] In June 2017, Bridgers signed to independent label Dead Oceans.

                        She released her debut studio album, Stranger in the Alps, in September to critical acclaim.[21][22] The album was produced by Tony Berg, Ethan Gruska and Rob Moose, all of whom would become consistent collaborators with Bridgers.[23] To promote the album, Bridgers performed on CBS This Morning and the NPR Tiny Desk.[24] Numerous songs from the record were featured in television productions throughout 2018, including Switched at Birth,[25] Castle,[26] Burden of Truth,[27] Lethal Weapon[28] and Trinkets,[29] among others.

                        Bridgers has been referred to as a "serial collaborator", and has either been featured on or co-released tracks with: Lord Huron, Fiona Apple, Matt Berninger and the National, Manchester Orchestra, the 1975, Maggie Rogers, Kid Cudi, Taylor Swift, and SZA, among others. In addition, she has participated in full-album projects with Conor Oberst, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus.[30][31]

                    <p>
                        In 2018, Bridgers teamed up with fellow indie singer-songwriters  <a href="#">Julien Baker</a> and Lucy Dacus to form the group Boygenius, signed to Matador Records.[32] They released three songs in August 2018 and subsequently announced an eponymous EP, which was released on October 26, 2018, to widespread acclaim.[33][34] Pitchfork called the collaboration "magic".[35] The band toured the U.S. in November, appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers and the NPR Tiny Desk.[36]

They released their debut album later that month through Dead Oceans.[39] The band appeared on CBS This Morning, and Bridgers appeared for the third time on NPR's Tiny Desk series.[40] Bob Boilen, creator of the Tiny Desk Concerts, said of their album: "It's that rare musical partnership where each injects vibrancy into the other's creative side."[41]

                    <h4>Punisher and Reunion Tour (2020–present)</h4>

She was slated to tour with them in summer 2020 before the tour's cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[43][44] On April 9, 2020, Bridgers released "Kyoto"[45] and announced on Instagram that her second album Punisher would be released on June 19, 2020. Bridgers released the album a day earlier than stated, stating: "I'm not [delaying] the record until things go back to 'normal' because I don't think they should. Here it is a little early."[46] The album received widespread positive reviews.[47][48] In July 2020, Bridgers released the music video for her single "I Know the End".[49] While working on Punisher, Bridgers also produced Christian Lee Hutson's album Beginners, which was released on Anti- Records in May 2020.[30] That September, she played to an all-virtual audience of 4 million at Red Rocks Amphitheatre as part of their Unpaused Concert Series. In October, Bridgers announced the formation of her own label Saddest Factory, an imprint of Dead Oceans.[50]

                        Bridgers' musical style has been described as mainly indie rock,[83][84] indie folk,[85][86] emo-folk,[87][88] and indie pop.[89] It often centers acoustic guitar, and incorporates atmospheric strings, production and electronic instrumentation. Her music has been described as "anxious", "melancholy" and "haunting". Themes include death, trauma, therapy, depression and strained relationships, "undercut by her dry wit" and "straightforward delivery."[90][1][91] Several of Bridgers' songs are about personal issues. For example, "Kyoto" was inspired by her relationship with her father, while "Motion Sickness" and "ICU" are about past breakups.[92][90] Her complex storytelling and use of evocative imagery, such as in "Garden Song", have also been commended.[93][94][91]

                        Bridgers has cited Elliott Smith as one of her favorite artists and the biggest influence on her songwriting and production style.[1][95][96] Her song "Punisher" explores her meeting Smith if he were still alive.[1] Other musical influences include bluegrass music, Bright Eyes, the Replacements, Blake Mills, Tom Waits, Avril Lavigne, The Beatles, Jackson Browne, Taylor Swift and Nine Inch Nails.[97][98][94][99][100] Her music often features a wide variety of popular culture references[101] — the writing of author Joan Didion, ASMR videos, television series Fleabag, and true crime podcast My Favorite Murder were all influential in the making of Punisher.[90][1][102][103]

                        In 2021, she received the Libera Awards as both Best Live/Livestream Act and Record of the Year 2021 for her album Punisher (Dead Oceans) by the American Association of Independent Music (A2IM).[104]

                        Both of Bridgers' albums contain Halloween-themed visual motifs, with the album covers of Stranger in the Alps and Punisher containing ghost and skeleton imagery respectively. She is known for wearing variations of a skeleton onesie, inspired by her reported love for "creepy and corny stuff".[105] Her fans are often referred to as "Pharbs", a play on Nicki Minaj fans calling themselves "Barbs".[106]
