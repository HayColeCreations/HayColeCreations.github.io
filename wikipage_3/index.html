                The <b>pomegranate</b> <i>(Punica granatum)</i> is a fruit-bearing deciduous shrub in the family Lythraceae, subfamily Punicoideae, that grows between 5 and 10 m (16 and 33 ft) tall.  
             </p>
             <p>
                The pomegranate was originally described throughout the Mediterranean region. It was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769.[4]
             </p>
             <p>
                The fruit is typically in season in the Southern Hemisphere from March to May, and in the Northern Hemisphere from September to February.[5][6] As intact sarcotestas or juice, pomegranates are used in baking, cooking, juice blends, meal garnishes, smoothies, and alcoholic beverages, such as cocktails and wine.  
             </p>
             <p>
                Pomegranates are widely cultivated throughout the Middle East and Caucasus region, north and tropical Africa, Iran, the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, the drier parts of Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin.[4]

                Etymology
             </h3>
             <hr>
             <p>
                The name pomegranate derives from medieval Latin <i>pōmum</i> "apple" and <i>grānātum</i> "seeded".[7] Possibly stemming from the old French word for the fruit, <i>pomme-grenade</i>, the pomegranate was known in early English as "apple of Grenada"—a term which today survives only in heraldic blazons. This is a folk etymology, confusing the Latin <i>granatus</i> with the name of the Spanish city of Granada, which derives from Arabic.[8]

             <p>
                Garnet derives from Old French grenat by metathesis, from Medieval Latin granatum as used in a different meaning "of a dark red color". This derivation may have originated from pomum granatum, describing the color of pomegranate pulp, or from granum, referring to "red dye, cochineal".[9]

                The modern French term for pomegranate, grenade, has given its name to the military grenade.[10]

             <p>
                A shrub or small tree growing 5 to 10 m (16 to 33 ft) high, the pomegranate has multiple spiny branches and is long-lived, with some specimens in France surviving for 200 years.[4] P. granatum leaves are opposite or subopposite, glossy, narrow oblong, entire, 3–7 cm (1+1⁄4–2+3⁄4 in) long and 2 cm (3⁄4 in) broad. The flowers are bright red and 3 cm (1+1⁄4 in) in diameter, with three to seven petals.[4] Some fruitless varieties are grown for the flowers alone.[11]

                Fruit, sarcotesta and seeds 
             </h4>
             <p>
                Red-purple in color, the pomegranate fruit  husk has two parts: an outer, hard pericarp, and an inner, spongy mesocarp (white "albedo"), which comprises the fruit inner wall where seeds attach.[12] Membranes of the mesocarp are organized as nonsymmetric chambers that contain seeds inside sarcotestas, which are embedded without attachment to the mesocarp.[12] Containing juice, the sarcotesta is formed as a thin membrane derived from the epidermal cells of the seeds.[13][14] The number of seeds in a pomegranate can vary from 200 to about 1,400.[15]
             <p>
                Botanically, the edible fruit is a berry with seeds and pulp produced from the ovary of a single flower.[13] The fruit is intermediate in size between a lemon and a grapefruit, 5–12 cm (2–4+1⁄2 in) in diameter with a rounded shape and thick, reddish husk.[4]

                In mature fruits, the juice obtained by compressing the seeds yields a sour flavor due to low pH (4.4) and high contents of polyphenols,[16] which may cause a red indelible stain on fabrics.[17] Primarily, the pigmentation of pomegranate juice results from the presence of anthocyanins and ellagitannins.[16][18]

                Cultivation 
             </h3>
             <hr>
             <p>
                P. granatum is grown for its fruit crop, and as ornamental trees and shrubs in parks and gardens. Mature specimens can develop sculptural twisted-bark multiple trunks and a distinctive overall form. Pomegranates are drought-tolerant, and can be grown in dry areas with either a Mediterranean winter rainfall climate or in summer rainfall climates. In wetter areas, they can be prone to root decay from fungal diseases. They can tolerate moderate frost, down to about −12 °C (10 °F).[19]
             </p>
             <p>
                Insect pests of the pomegranate can include the butterflies Virachola isocrates, Iraota timoleon, Deudorix epijarbas, and the leaf-footed bug Leptoglossus zonatus, and fruit flies and ants are attracted to unharvested ripe fruit.[20] Pomegranate grows easily from seed, but is commonly propagated from 25 to 50 cm (10 to 20 in) hardwood cuttings to avoid the genetic variation of seedlings. Air layering is also an option for propagation, but grafting fails.[4]

                P. granatum var. nana is a dwarf variety of P. granatum popularly planted as an ornamental plant in gardens and larger containers, and used as a bonsai specimen tree. It could well be a wild form with a distinct origin. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[21][22]
             </p>
             <p>
                The only other species in the genus Punica is the Socotran pomegranate (P. protopunica), which is endemic to the Socotran archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea, the largest island of which is also known as Socotra. The territory is part of Yemen. It differs in having pink (not red) flowers and smaller, less sweet fruit.[23]

                Cultivars
            </h4>
            <p>
                P. granatum has more than 500 named cultivars, but evidently has considerable synonymy in which the same genotype is named differently across regions of the world.[12]
            </p>
            <p>
                Several characteristics between pomegranate genotypes vary for identification, consumer preference, preferred use, and marketing, the most important of which are fruit size, exocarp color (ranging from yellow to purple, with pink and red most common), seed-coat color (ranging from white to red), the hardness of seed, maturity, juice content and its acidity, sweetness, and astringency.[12]

            Production and export

         </h3>
         The leading producers globally are India and China followed by Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, the US, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and Spain.[24] During 2019, Chile, Peru, Egypt, Israel, India, and Turkey supplied pomegranates to the European market.[25] Chile was the main supplier to the United States market, which has a limited supply from Southern California.[25] China was self-sufficient for its pomegranate supply in 2019, while other South Asia markets were supplied mainly by India.[25] Pomegranate production and exports in South Africa competed with South American shipments in 2012–18, with export destinations including Europe, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, and Russia.[26] South Africa imports pomegranates mainly from Israel.[26]
